---------- Java Interpreter ----------
The first object out of the vector: The vehicle ID is: 0 The name of the vehicle is:   The initial velocity is 0.0 The initial distance is 0.0 The final velocity is: 0.0m/sec The final distance is: 0.0m
The first object at index 0 out of the vector after we set its initial distance and initial velocity The vehicle ID is: 0 The name of the vehicle is:   The initial velocity is 2.0 The initial distance is 5.0 The final velocity is: 4.0m/sec The final distance is: 8.0m
The second object at index 1 out of the vector after we set its initial distance and initial velocity The vehicle ID is: 0 The name of the vehicle is:   The initial velocity is 0.0 The initial distance is 0.0 The final velocity is: 6.0m/sec The final distance is: 6.0m
Object at index 0is The vehicle ID is: 0 The name of the vehicle is:   The initial velocity is 0.0 The initial distance is 0.0 The final velocity is: 6.0m/sec The final distance is: 6.0m
