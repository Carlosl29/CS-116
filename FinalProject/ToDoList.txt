								Final Project:
							--------------------
-Calculate Electric field at point of interest based on position of point charges

Steps:
----------
Input text file:
Q:2,-1,-0.00000003
Q:2,-3,+0.00000003
P:P1,0,-2

1.) Read in data from text file with data in it
	a.) Data consist of first a charge (Q)
		1.)First token starts after the (:)
		2.)First token is x-coordinate
		3.)Second token is y-coordinate
		4.)Third token is charge amount
	b.) Then followed by a second charge(Q)
		1.)Data starts after (:)
		2.)First token is x
		3.)Second token is y
		4.)Third token is charge amount
	c.) The third line is a point of interest(P)
		1.)Data starts after (:)
		2.)First token is name of point
		3.)Second token is x
		4.)Third token is y
2.)

Required files:
1.) 	1 abstract super class -check
4.) 	2 sub classes - check
2.) 	1 class that is serializable, and produce serialized objects - check
3.) 	1 interface with 3 abstract methods - check
5.) 	1 custom exception - check
6.) 	1 class that represents xy cordinates - check
7.) 	1 class that is electric fields - check
8.) 	1 class with main method - check
9.) 	Must read text file with input data
10.)	Serialized objects are saved in binary coded file, one line is one object - check
11.) 	When text file is read back, objects are typecast, and content is displayed
