							--------------------
-Calculate Electric field at point of interest based on position of point charges


Steps:
----------
Input text file:
Q:2,-1,-0.00000003
Q:2,-3,+0.00000003
P:P1,0,-2

1.) Read in data from text file with data in it
	a.) Data consist of first a charge (Q)
		1.)First token starts after the (:)
		2.)First token is x-coordinate
		3.)Second token is y-coordinate
		4.)Third token is charge amount
	b.) Then followed by a second charge(Q)
		1.)Data starts after (:)
		2.)First token is x
		3.)Second token is y
		4.)Third token is charge amount
	c.) The third line is a point of interest(P)
		1.)Data starts after (:)
		2.)First token is name of point
		3.)Second token is x
		4.)Third token is y
2.)

-----------------------------------------
Required files:
1.) 	1 abstract super class
4.) 	2 sub classes 
2.) 	1 class that is serializable, and produce serialized objects
3.) 	1 interface with 3 abstract methods
5.) 	1 custom exception
6.) 	1 class that is represents xy cordinates
7.) 	1 class that is electric fields
8.) 	1 class with main method
9.) 	Must read text file with input data
10.)	Serialized objects are saved in binary coded file, one line is one object
11.) 	When text file is read back, objects are typecast, and content is displayed
